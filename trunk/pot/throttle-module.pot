msgid "The throttle module provides a congestion control throttling mechanism for automatically detecting a surge in incoming traffic. If the site gets linked to by a popular website, or otherwise comes under a \"Denial of Service\" (DoS) attack, your webserver might become overwhelmed. This mechanism is utilized by other modules to automatically optimize their performance by temporarily disabling CPU-intensive functionality. For example, in the site theme, you might choose to disable pictures when the site is too busy (reducing bandwidth), or in modules, you might choose to disable some complicated logic (reducing CPU utilization)."

For example, to start the throttle when your site has 250 anonymous users online at once, enter '250' in this field. Leave this value blank or set to \"0\" if you do not wish to auto-throttle on anonymous users. You can inspect the current number of anonymous users using the \"Who's online\" block."

msgid "The auto-throttle probability limiter is an efficiency mechanism to statistically reduce the overhead of the auto-throttle. The limiter is expressed as a percentage of page views, so for example if set to the default of 10% we only perform the extra database queries to update the throttle status 1 out of every 10 page views. The busier your site, the lower you should set the limiter value."
